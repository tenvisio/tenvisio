# 👋 I’m Ananth — @tenvisio

> Building systems that **think**, **communicate**, and **learn**.

I work at the intersection of **AI**, **real-time systems**, and **human learning** — building technology that moves at the speed of thought.

This account is my **public engineering space** — a home for open-source systems, experiments, and infrastructure projects that explore how intelligence moves through networks, code, and time.

My current focus is a **long-term inquiry** into systems that explore the edges of intelligence and interaction:

---

### 🧭 Long-Term Project — *Stealth*
My ongoing long-term work sits under the codename **School of Quest** —  
an inquiry into how humans and machines learn together.  
It’s a deep, multi-year exploration at the intersection of learning systems, design, and intelligence.

### ⚡ Pulse
An open-source real-time communication engine designed for sub-millisecond event flow.  
Fast, reliable, and built for the next generation of intelligent systems.

---

### 🧠 What I Work On
- Real-time computation and dataflow systems  
- AI inference and agent infrastructure  
- Computer vision at the edge  
- Scalable backend architecture  
- Learning systems and human-AI interfaces  

My work often extends beyond software into the **network, data, and physical layers** —  
building the connective tissue that lets intelligence operate in real time.  
That means designing systems that don’t just think, but **communicate** across machines, sensors, and datacenters with precision and intent.

### 🌐 Network Architecture & Routing Systems
Designing and optimizing networks that carry intelligence:
- **IoT Network Design:** sensor orchestration, device coordination, and distributed telemetry  
- **Routing Systems:** BGP, static, and dynamic route planning for low-latency, fault-tolerant systems  
- **Firewall Frameworks:** deep packet inspection, custom rule engines, and micro-segmentation  
- **NAT Architectures:** scalable designs for high-density and specialized environments  
- **Datacenter Infrastructure:** network topologies, VLAN design, GPU interconnects, and high-availability routing  

Networks that don’t just connect systems — they **synchronize intelligence**.

---

### 🎥 Video Intelligence Systems
Architecting the stack for high-performance video analytics:
- **Recording & Object Stores** — optimized for petabyte-scale, synchronized, multi-camera ingest  
- **Vision Analytics Pipelines** — classical & transformer-based perception and real-time inference  
- **Edge Streaming Networks** — adaptive routing for low-latency visual intelligence  

Deployed across surveillance, robotics, and autonomous systems.

### 👁️ Computer Vision & Edge Inference
Real-time vision architectures for perception, tracking, and decision-making.  
Built for GPU acceleration and edge deployment.

---

### 🛰️ Autonomous Command Centres
Distributed orchestration and perception systems for autonomous missions.  
Combining vision, telemetry, and inference into cohesive operational awareness.

---

### 🧩 Research & Infrastructure
Explorations in:
- Real-time AI inference and agentic reasoning  
- Network optimization and distributed communication  
- Compiler-level acceleration for AI workloads  
- Multi-agent collaboration and context memory  
- System visualization and flow orchestration  

---

### 💭 What I Believe
> The fastest system is the one that **understands**.  
> The smartest machine is the one that **learns alongside humans**.  
> Every millisecond saved — every question answered — brings us closer to clarity.
